# Compare Dev Topics

See a live demo: https://maxwellhankner.github.io/compare-dev-topics/

## How To Use:

- __Step 1)__ In the search box, enter a dev topic you are interested in learning more about.
- __Step 2)__ If you would like to compare two or more topics, simply add them to the list by clicking the plus button.
- __Step 3)__ Hit search once you are ready to learn about your topic(s).

Once the results come back, you can see just how popular a topic is by the amount of projects that are being hosted on Github (The worlds most popular place for programmers to store code). You will also see the amount of questions that have been asked on Stack Overflow (The worlds most popular programming Q&A forum). These two charts will give you a better idea of how popular a certain topic alone or relative to one another.

You will also find a collection of links to the top projects on Github, as well as a collection of the most common questions being asked by developers. Click on the links to find out more about the topic(s) you have searched.
